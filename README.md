# Machine Learning

This repository contains my implementations and experiments of Machine Learning algorithms in Python. 
The codes are based on what I've learned doing the course [Machine Learning of Coursera by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (taught using Octave/MATLAB) and on the programming exercises of the course. It's also based on my studies of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/).

In order to have a nice visualization of the concepts, formulas, codes and experiments, I did all the implementations in [Jupyther Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
